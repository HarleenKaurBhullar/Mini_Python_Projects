# Timed Typing Test 

## Overview:

* Test and improve your typing speed and accuracy in a fun, timed environment.

* Choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level has multiple sentences to keep you challenged.

* As you type, mistakes are **highlighted in red** in real time, so you know immediately if you made an error.

* At the end of the test, your **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and **accuracy (%)** are calculated, and your highscore is saved for future sessions.

## How to Run:
* Make sure you have **Python 3** and **Tkinter** installed.

  - On Ubuntu/Debian:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-tk
  ```
  - On Windows/macOS: Tkinter comes bundled with Python 3.
  - Navigate to the Typing Speed Test folder:
  
  ```bash
  cd Mini_Python_Projects/Typing Speed Test
  ```
  - Run the application:
  ```bash
  python3 typing_speed_test.py
  ```

## How to Play:

* Select a difficulty level and click **Start Test**.

* Type the text shown in the reference area as accurately and quickly as you can.

* Keep typing continuously until the timer runs out.

* Watch your errors in real time and aim for the highest WPM with the best accuracy.

* Highscores are tracked locally, so you can keep improving over time.
